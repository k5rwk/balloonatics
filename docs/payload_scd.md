## FAA Part 101 Exempt Flights

Our flights are operated are exempt from FAA Part 101.  We achieve this by adhering to the following payload rules:
- Carries a payload package that weighs more than four pounds and has a weight/size ratio of more than three ounces per square inch on any surface of the package, determined by dividing the total weight in ounces of the payload package by the area in square inches of its smallest surface;
- Carries a payload package that weighs more than six pounds;
- Carries a payload, of two or more packages, that weighs more than 12 pounds; or
- Uses a rope or other device for suspension of the payload that requires an impact force of more than 50 pounds to separate the suspended payload from the balloon.Subpart D – Unmanned Free Balloons paragraph 101.31 – 

We generally fly under the requirement that our total payload weight shall be under 12 pounds.

## Special Considerations

While exempt from the other rules with section 101, there are several requirements that the flights are planned to follow.  They are outlined below:
- Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, below 2,000 feet above the surface within the lateral boundaries of the surface areas of Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E airspace designated for an airport;
- At any altitude where there are clouds or obscuring phenomena of more than five-tenths coverage;
- At any altitude below 60,000 feet standard pressure altitude where the horizontal visibility is less than five miles;
- During the first 1,000 feet of ascent, over a congested area of a city, town, or settlement or an open-air assembly of persons not associated with the operation; or
- In such a manner that impact of the balloon, or part thereof including its payload, with the surface creates a hazard to persons or property not associated with the operation.
- No person may operate between sunrise and sunset an unmanned free balloon that is equipped with a suspension device (other than a highly conspicuously colored open parachute) more than 50 feet along, unless the suspension device is colored in alternate bands of high conspicuity colors or has colored pennants or streamers attached which are visible for at least one mile.

The details of the flight, including the launch location, payload string composition and projected recovery location will be coordinated by the launch team before the day of the launch.

## Payload Design

It is desired to allow as many payloads as possible on a flight string.  Individual payloads should be designed to with the following maximum dimensions:
- Mass 
  - Target 450 grams / 1.0 lbs.
  - Maximum 700 grams / 1.5 lbs.
- Volume
  - Target 6,000 cm3 / 370 in3 (Dual faucet cover design)
  - Maximum 8,200 cm3 / 500 in3
- Bridle Attachment
  - Each payload shall be supplied by the builder with a suitable bridle to attach to the payload sting.
  - The weight of the bridle will be included in the total payload mass.
  - The bridle shall be designed to allow the payload to hang vertically.
  - The bridle shall be designed to support a static load of a minimum of 100 lbs. Typical material is paracord or braided mason’s line.  Remember, if your payload fails, all payloads below yours may also fail.
  - Each end of the bridle shall be supplied with a suitable loop to attach other payloads.  Bowline knot is typically used.
  - As part of the payload string a safety lanyard will be provided between the upper and lower attachments points of your bridle.  This will be supplied by the launch team.  Dimensional Considerations
  - The length of the bridle shall be no more than 24 in. and shall be exceed the total length of the payload including any antennas or sensors.

## Label

The payload shall be marked with the following information:
- HARMLESS AMATEUR RADIO EXPERIMENT
- Payload Builder Name
- Builder phone number and / or email address

To the extent possible each major removable component should be marked.

## Battery Life

The average time from launch to burst is 1.5 hours.  If the design records data from launch to recovery you should plan on the following:
- 1.0 hours from test to launch
- 1.5 hours from launch to burst
- 1.5 hours burst to landing
- 1 hour recovery

While not necessary the battery life should be planned for 5 hours

## Frequency Coordination

If the payload is equipped with a transmitter, its frequency must be coordinated in advance with the RF Coordinator.  This shall be done a minimum of 2 weeks in advance of the launch to ensure the payloads do not interfere with one another.  It is desired that the payload has an adjustable frequency.  The following information will need to be supplied:
- Frequency range the payload can operation.
- Power Level
- Transmit bandwidth
- Modulation scheme

This information should be marked on the outside of the payload.
